# What is OpenLetter
OpenLetter is the idea of a completely free social media.
<b><ul>
  <li>End-to-end encryption.</li>
  <li>Would not collect any unnecessary data/spy on you.</li>
  <li>The privacy settings, unlike many other social medias, would be on by default.</li>
<li>All the code, with the exception of the databases passwords (for obvious security reasons), is going to be listed</li>
</ul></b>

We are starting programmers, so the code is probably going to be full of errors, we would be very happy if you could help by either sending new code or improving ours.
