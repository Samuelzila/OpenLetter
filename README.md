# What is OpenLetter #
OpenLetter is the idea of a completely free social media.
<b><ul>
  <li>End-to-end encryption.</li>
  <li>Would not collect any unnecessary data/spy on you.</li>
  <li>The privacy settings, unlike many other social medias, would be on by default.</li>
  <li>All the code, with the exception of the databases passwords (for obvious security reasons), is going to be listed</li>
</ul></b>

We are starting programmers, so the code is probably going to be full of errors, we would be very happy if you could help by either sending new code or improving ours.

### Requirements ###
In order to run the webserver, you will need:
<ul>
  <li>Any webserver (coded and tested on apache2)</li>
  <li>PHP (coded and tested on php7.4)</li>
  <li>MySQL (make sure pdo_mysql is enabled in php.ini)</li>
  <li>Even if not necessary, I recomend phpmyadmin</li>
</ul>
Coded and tested on ubuntu 20.4

here is how you should be able to install all dependencies using the apt package manager on linux:<br>
code(sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apache2 php mysql-server phpmyadmin)
